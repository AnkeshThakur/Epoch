Description of the app:

The Epoch calendar is a web-based application that displays the calendar of any month of any year. The range of year given
is from 1902 to 2037. It is built using php, html, css and javascript. 

The whole code is contained in a single file called as index.php
Two parameters, namely year and month are passed to index.php. In case, no parameters are passed, the page stores current
system date value in the corresponding variables.

The whole page is divided into 5 divs:
	1. Title div: Shows the title of the calendar. This div contains an image and a text.

	2. Decade div: This div contains tabs for choosing decade. It is provided so that user doesn't need to scroll up
		through a long list as categorising into decades will shorten up the 'year' list and now it will contain
		only ten values. The decade tabs are made using a single row table, with an image provided as the background
		for each cell and onClick events are specified for each cell. On clicking a particular cell, a javascript
		function is called, and the div(Year div) corresponding to that cell is displayed and rest are hide.

	3. Year div: This div is displayed when a decade is choosen from the decade list. It contains a from with two select
		elements, year and month. User has to choose from these values to display the calendar for the desired 
		month. On submitting the form, year and month values are passed to same page i.e. index.php via GET method.

	4. Calendar div: This divs displays the calendar of the month choosen by the user. It contains a background image on
		which calendar is displayed. The calendar is generated using date() function of php. A table, with desired
		number of rows is prepared by the code, and values are filled in the cells. 
		Code behind the calendar: Two variables, $year and $month are used to store the values of the year and
		month for which the calendar has to be prepared. Three variables, $no_of_days(used for storing number of
		days of the month choosen), $strt_day(used for storing the day at which 1st date of month falls) and $blanks
		(used for storing the blank spaces before the 1st date of month) are initialised. Then a php script is 
		executed to fill the cells of the table with corresponding date values.
 
	5  Prev/next divs: These divs are made for easier navigation between different months. It has been constructed as
		an additional feature with the calendar. These divs contains images with link provided to each image.
		Prev div, on clicking, passes value of the month previous to the value currently stored in $month, to
		index.php, and hence, calendar for previous month is displayed. Similarly, for next div, link is provided
		that, on clicking, passes month value one greater to index.php and hence, calendar for next month is displayed.
